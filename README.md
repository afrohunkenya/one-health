## Problem

Doctors who work in busy public hospitals with few medical personnel are exhausted. They need to attend to their immunocompromised patients within a short period of time.

Because the patients are suffering from zoonotic, warterborne and diseases resulting from environmental pollution and delays can lead to serious health complications

## Solution

### Information Sharing

The portal is a communication channel between different departments in the healthcare system involving the medical personnel, public health workers and veterinary.

It enables doctors to consult between each another and report on unfamiliar/unusual/frequent cases in the hospital

### Online Appointments

Doctors can schedule/book online meetings prior to hospital visits. This is only done for non-serious conditions. It also allows patients to seek advice from the doctor without physical proximity to them.

It reduces the doctors' workload, congestion in the hospital and physical proximity during disease outbreaks like COVID-19 or Ebola

### Illness Statistics

Using the appointments, data analysis is done on the illnesses and charts are drawn. The charts show top illnesses and emerging illnesses

It eases disease surveillance. Through this doctors can make necessary interventions and inform their patients on precautionary measures
